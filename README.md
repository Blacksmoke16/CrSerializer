# CrSerializer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Blacksmoke16/CrSerializer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Blacksmoke16/CrSerializer)
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Blacksmoke16/CrSerializer.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/CrSerializer/releases)

JSON/YAML serializer and validator inspired by [JMS Serializer Annotations](https://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer/master/reference/annotations) and [Symfony Validation Constraint Annotations](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html).

## Goals

- Extensible and customizable to fit all use cases
- Make working with JSON APIs in Crystal much easier
- Be easy to adopt and start using effectively
- Work out of the box with most ORMs (assuming they are compatible with adding annotations and use properties)
